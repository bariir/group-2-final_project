### Overview / Purpose
  - For My groups final project of the course we have chosen to take on a large spotify data set and organize it to see what makes music popular in multiple categories including tempo, beats per minute, danceability, energy and others. 
  - Fist we have decided to focus on a few main categories and leave the others out that we felt not necessary. The categories we are using are tempo, liveness instrumentals, aucustics, speech, loudness, energy, and danceability.

### Communication protocols
  - For our communication between members of the group we have decided that we will primarily use github, Slack, Zoom and office hours. 
  - Creating our own Zoom meeting times / dates has really helped each other understand the code we are writing, help each other write code, and take advantage of our off days from class.
