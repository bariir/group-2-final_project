### Overview / Purpose


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Needing to drop nulls from the dataset to find a precise and accurate outcome.

  - Getting rid of na's to get the Dataset even more precise so we can show an accurate outcome on the correlation heatmap.

  - The correlation heatmap itself comparing categories with one another.

### Communication protocols
  - For our communication between members of the group we have decided that we will primarily use github, Slack, Zoom and office hours. 
  - Creating our own Zoom meeting times / dates has really helped each other understand the code we are writing, help each other write code, and take advantage of our off days from class.


### Technology used
  - When it comes to the technology our group is using we are able to branch off and use a wide variety of programs. Programs will be provided in bullet form below. 

  - Python
  - VBA
  - Tableau
  - Matplotlib
  - Javascript
  - PostgreSQL
  - QuickDBD
