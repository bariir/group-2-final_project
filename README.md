### Overview / Purpose
  - For our groups final project of the course we have chosen to take on a large Spotify dataset and organize it to see what makes music popular in multiple categories including tempo, danceability, energy and others. 
  - First we have decided to focus on a few main categories and leave the others out that we felt not necessary. The categories we are using are tempo, liveness, instrumentals, acoustics, speech, loudness, energy, and danceability.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
  - 
### Roles
  - Triangle - Huzeyfe: Create A mockup for our machine learning model.
  - Square - Mohamed: Responsible for the repository. 
  - Circle - Ken: Create A mockup of a database with A set of sample data.
  - X - Kevin: Decide which technologies we will be using for each step of the project. 
  - 
### Communication protocols
  - For our communication between members of the group we have decided that we will primarily use github, Slack, Zoom and office hours. 
  - Creating our own Zoom meeting times / dates has really helped each other understand the code we are writing, help each other write code, and take advantage of our off days from class.

### Outline
  - Our first thought was to practice with a smaller data set to iron out any unforseen road blocks that may come up. 
  - Next we started our code

### Technology used
  - When it comes to the technology our group is using we are able to branch off and use a wide variety of programs. Programs will be provided in bullet form below. 

  - Python
  - Tableau
  - Matplotlib
  - Javascript
  - PostgreSQL
  - QuickDBD
